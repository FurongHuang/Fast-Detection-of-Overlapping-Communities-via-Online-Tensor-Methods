Fast-Detection-of-Overlapping-Communities-via-Online-Tensor-Methods
===================================================================

We present a fast tensor-based approach for detecting hidden overlapping communities under the Mixed Membership Stochastic Blockmodel (MMSB). We present two implementations, viz., a GPU-based implementation which exploits the parallelism of SIMD architectures and a CPU-based implementation for larger datasets, wherein the GPU memory does not suffice.
